If you follow me on social media, you probably already know that DADI is running a crowdsale event to fund our vision for a decentralised fog network in support of our microservices suite. Even though the sale doesn't start until the 22nd, it gained a phenomenal amount of attention from day one, and the number of people that registered their interest has heavily surpassed our most ambitious predictions.

Yesterday, the community flocked to various channels to show grave concerns about our whitepaper, claiming that we plagiarised it from a company called SONM. This post is my view – not DADI’s – on the matter.<!--more-->

Anyone who’s ever written a theoretical document or thesis knows that research is an important part of the process. You look around to see who else is doing something that is remotely close to what you’re trying to achieve, and you look at how they’re doing it. If you find something that is good, that you respect, you’re going to lean on it, in one way or another, to produce your own work.

When you do that, however, you cite your sources and you credit the author. We didn’t. We should’ve reviewed the paper thoroughly to ensure that any scaffolding sections taken from various sources to be used as references later to be reworked and reshaped were actually reworked and reshaped. We didn’t. We dropped the ball on that one.

But you know what’s really frustrating for someone who’s involved in the project? It’s just noise. It was an honest mistake that sends the wrong message about who we are as a company and as engineers.

**If you were in my shoes**, you’d spend your days building:

- A service that allows you to create a RESTful API in seconds, that is scalable, fully customisable, supporting virtually any database engine
- A platform for creating a website, static or dynamic, with data from any type of source, giving developers the freedom to choose any type of templating engine
- A visionary digital asset delivery and manipulation layer that gives developers the tools to manipulate images on the fly, do automated art direction on the web with ease, serve targeted content based on location, device and network connectivity to ensure optimal performance, transform CSS and JavaScript on the edge based on browser capabilities
- A content management system that simply works as a window for the content, liberating developers instead of dictating the entire technology stack that they must use 

These are just some of the pieces of the puzzle that is our microservices stack. Fully open-source for the community to use as they please. Prototypes or proofs of concept? No. These are powering digital products used by 200 million users every month.

**If you were in my shoes** you’d get to work with a team of talented and passionate engineers, putting in a huge effort every single day. And for those reasons, you’d be absolutely gutted to see the credibility of everything you do be put in question because of a PR hiccup.

We’re asking for people’s hard-earned money, so it’s fair that we’re put under scrutiny. **If I were in your shoes**, I’d raise questions too. It looks off, I get that. But look for answers to those questions in a civil manner, instead of spreading hate and misinformation.

How? Go through [our GitHub repositories](https://github.com/dadi) to see the work that we do. Read our updated [whitepaper](http://dadi.link/kx) to see for yourself what we're about. Read my blog and [my tweets](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas) to see the content I share with the community every day. See [my video channel](https://eduardoboucas.com/video/) and watch the talks I’ve delivered at conferences and developer meetups about the stuff we build for the community. Hell, call my university and [previous employers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardoboucas/) to see if I am who I say I am, and do that for every single one of [my colleagues](https://dadi.cloud/en/team).

If at the end you’re still not convinced, I respect your decision. Skip this one and invest somewhere else. But please, respect the work that we, as humans that sometimes don’t get things right, proudly do every day.<!--tomb-->
