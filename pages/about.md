Hello, fellow passenger of this incredible ride that is web development. I've been building websites since the turn of the century — I like to think that I've got the hang of it, but the content published here will most certainly indicate otherwise. You're reading *Build Times*, my modest collection of thoughts, experiments, ramblings and rants about the daily goings-on of an individual who gets paid to write gibberish at the computer — these posts are on the house, though.

I'm a Principal Engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and I maintain several [open-source projects](https://github.com/eduardoboucas). I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas), <a rel="me" href="https://infra.social/@eduardoboucas">toot</a>, and occasionally [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/eduardoboucas).

Thanks for dropping by. <!--tomb-->
