Hello, fellow passenger of this incredible ride that is web development. I've been building websites since the turn of the century â€“ I like to think that I've got the hang of it, but the content published here will most certainly indicate otherwise. You're reading *Build Times*: my modest collection of thoughts, experiments, ramblings and rants about the daily goings-on of an individual who gets paid to write gibberish at the computer (but the rants are on the house).

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and I maintain several [open-source projects](https://github.com/eduardoboucas). I also [tweet](https://twitter.com/eduardoboucas) and occasionally [speak](https://speakerdeck.com/eduardoboucas).

This site is built with [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) and the source code is [publicly available](https://github.com/eduardoboucas). Thanks for dropping by. <!--tomb-->
