Born in the north of Portugal, I'm a software engineer with camp set up in London, England. I am a firm supporter of an open, free and independent world-wide web, and an advocate of open source software. I'm a Principal Engineer at [DADI](https://dadi.cloud), making all-round awesome things with a strong focus on API-first back-end and front-end systems, and the principle of [COPE](https://dadi.cloud/en/knowledge/web-services/api-first-and-cope). I also maintain a few [open-source projects](/projects).
