I mentioned [include-media](http://include-media.com) quite a few times in various posts on this blog, but I don't think I mentioned some of the plugins that me and the community have built around it. I thought it'd be useful to make a quick video showing how *I* use the library in my projects and how I make use of some plugins to make my life easier.<!--more-->

You can watch the video below and try the demo for yourself using the embedded CodePen. If you want to give the plugins a try, you'll want [include-media](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media), [include-media-columns](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-columns) and [include-media-export](https://github.com/eduardoboucas/include-media-export).
