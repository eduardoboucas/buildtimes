Earlier this month, I gave [a talk](https://ldnwebperf.org/sessions/speedtracker-org-a-new-open-source-wrapper-for-webpagetest/) about [SpeedTracker](/blog/2016/12/15/introducing-speedtracker.html) at [London Web Performance](https://ldnwebperf.org), a monthly meetup for web performance professionals and enthusiasts, hosted at The Financial Times, in London. It was a great opportunity to spread the word about the project and get feedback from fellow developers. Hopefully, it also served to recruit some open-source lovers to help me with this endeavour!<!--more-->

A big shout out to [Perry](https://twitter.com/perrydyball) for organising the event, to [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonhearne) for his [amazing talk](https://ldnwebperf.org/sessions/optimising-for-25000-unique-devices/) and to everyone that attended. I'll leave you with the video and slides of my talk.<!--tomb-->
