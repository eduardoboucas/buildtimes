Earlier this week, I delivered a talk titled *COPE and Node.js microservices*, based on [the article I wrote on CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/learning-cope-microservices/).

It happened at [BragaJS](http://www.meetup.com/bragajs/), a local meet-up organised by [Subvisual](https://subvisual.co/) in Braga, Portugal. It was a great opportunity for me to connect a bit more with the local dev community, which I somewhat lost touch with since I moved to London.<!--more-->

The slides are [available here](https://speakerdeck.com/eduardoboucas/cope-with-node-dot-js-microservices) and the talk can be seen in the video below (sound is not great, sorry about that).<!--tomb-->
