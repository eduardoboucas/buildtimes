Born in the north of Portugal at a very young age, I'm a software engineer with camp set up in London, England. I am a firm supporter of an open, free and independent world-wide web, and an advocate of open source software. I'm a Senior Engineer at [DADI](https://dadi.tech), making all-round awesome things with a strong focus on API-first back-end and front-end systems, and the principle of [COPE](https://dadi.tech/en/concepts/api-first-and-cope/). I also maintain a few [open-source projects](/projects).
