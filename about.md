That's how it all begins, isn't it? To me, it started when I was around 11 and I became friends with the new and overwhelming world of the Internet. My first contact with programming happened in the next couple of years as I spent endless hours relentlessly trying to extend the functionalities of mIRC using its built-in programming language. Even though I was still a kid, I became addicted to the thrill of experimenting with code and creating things with it.

That thrill completely shaped the rest of my life, as it made me pursue an education in computer science and a career as a developer. I was exposed to an immense number of programming languages, paradigms, principles and tools, and even after all these years I still feel that same thrill and rush when I learn a new language or platform and open a text editor to write a new **Hello world**.

I since developed an OCD for code that is elegant, robust, reusable and maintainable. I have a passion for the web and I firmly believe in open source and open standards. I love great design, photography and typography fascinate me. I love writing code, but see myself as a creative developer rather than a code monkey. My slogan used to be *«I live in science, but I breathe art»*. I was told it sounds too cheesy.
